## Performance Metrics

| Feature | Accuracy | Processing Speed |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Face Detection | 99.5% | 0.2s/photo |
| Scene Recognition | 95% | 0.3s/photo |
| Object Detection | 92% | 0.4s/photo |
| Emotion Analysis | 88% | 0.1s/photo |

## Code Example

```python
from photo_organizer import PhotoAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = PhotoAnalyzer(model='advanced')

# Analyze a photo
results = analyzer.analyze('family_photo.jpg')

print(f"Detected {len(results.faces)} faces")
print(f"Scene type: {results.scene}")
print(f"Objects: {', '.join(results.objects)}")
```
